Formed by the Draia, [[Agrona Vritra]], after his loss in his conflict against the dragons. Meritocratic society that employs the ‘blood’ system, a caste system centered around power of blood. This is because most of the people of Alacrya are “adorned” or have some Leviathan blood flowing through them in order to increase their magical power, with the more powerful named or high bloods having more. The “unadorned” are treated as lesser beings by most of Alacryan society and are basically slaves to the adorned, some of them are too weak to receive a crest (or sigil or regalia) symbolizing the Vritra blood in them and some believe it compromises their humanity or morality. The entire country can be turned into a battle force and they are the most devoted population to their leader as they depend on him for power, making Alacrya a fighting force on par with the other nations despite their smaller size.
