Unified country in their beliefs, very spiritual people, use the I Ching a lot. Formed by “The First Emperor” Wei when he traveled from the upper floors down to the 23rd, gathering the most discriminated people and teaching them of the mysticism of nature and its plan. Those who followed his teachings went with them and quickly their numbers grew as they traveled down the tower. It is during this time that Wei wrote the I Ching which he claimed carried the knowledge and insights of the Natural Tower. Once the book was completed they stopped their pilgrimage at the Great Wall and established the city of Wei.

I Ching: they do not worship the gods generally and instead take wisdom from nature in the form of throwing fifty yarrow stalks in the air and seeing what trigram they fall into and reading from the I Ching (E Ching), each formation indicates a different fortune number, they consult it for lots of things like job interviews and marriage proposals etc.
