Leadership: The country is divided into three sub countries, each of which operates under a monarchy with a traditional noble houses structure

The Lances: The most powerful warriors in the land who act directly in service of the leaders of their kingdoms.  The human leadership behind King Albert was the one to suggest the formation of the Lances, but they wanted to make the number of Lances representative of the population in leadership so the human’s could control the power. The other races opposed this and eventually it was limited to just two per race and established with the first selection in 3E 670.
