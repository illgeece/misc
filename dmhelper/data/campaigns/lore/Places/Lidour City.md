“The Emerald City”
Large city of more than 50,000 people, with about half being elves of each of the five tribes. Governed by the city administrator who answers directly to the Tribal Alliance Leader, who lives in the Emerald Palace in the heart of the city right by the Great Maple. 
**Great Maple**: The Maple is an enormous tree more than 500 feet tall with giant maple leaves in the top branches and smaller ones in the lower branches which start about 200 feet up the tree and branch out as much as half a mile, giving the area great shade but still allowing sunlight through in amber beams.
