The capital city in the middle of the territory on the 23rd floor. Characterized by its closeness to the Great Wall Mountain, which acts as a natural shield from most of the avenues of attack. It is a mountain that is very sheer on one side (70 degrees) and completely 90 degrees straight up on the other side, formed by part of Geolus’ body when he was slain by the ancient dragons. The Emperor’s palace sits in the middle of the inside of the mountain, right up against the tallest part of the back wall.
