She begs the PCs to find him and uncover the truth.

After a few tense moments, the figure leaves, but the apothecary, Tethysebb Deepcurrent, looks nervous and asks the PCs to investigate.

The apothecary tells the PCs that this figure has appeared before, always with cryptic warnings. They believe the figure is tied to some ancient curse or legend surrounding the cove.
