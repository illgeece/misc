**- Imperial Palace
    

- Emperor Taijhei Fujimura: 29, son of Sho “The War Chest” who died along with most of his family in an uprising by the inner cabinet 7 years before the current time, leaving the youngest Taihei who was away at the time. He is a good leader who is respected by most of the people in the public and the cabinet aside from some of the old leaders. He cares deeply for the population but is overwhelmed by the impossibilities of overcoming his various obstacles. This has caused him to heap much responsibility on Omawari including that of the policing and the war relations between the other territories. 
    
- Shinpei Manamura: The timid, blundering interim leader of the Manamura family in place of his father Hanpei.

- Akazu: The first lady’s house, home of the wife of the emperor. Even though it only controls the courtesans on the surface the house carries much power in the Zhou society, with much of the powerful and oldest families in the back pocket of the house. It is made up of only women, the Akazunori (first lady) and the courtesans, with the only men inside being an undisclosed number of eunuchs that serve the Akazunori. 
    

- Rikorumi Kurai: The current Akazunori after the last one killed herself on the grave of Sho the day after his burial. 
    

- The Shintai: basically the secret service and military combined, made up of the strongest warriors in the empire and take orders directly from the emperor. 
    

- Shintai Head: Omawari “The Dragon With No Left Hand”: A legendary warrior from the previous emperor’s time, was very loyal to him as they shared the same warlike personality, less so to Taihei. Controls much of the Zhou society, including some of the black market and believes he makes the law and keeps the safety so it does not apply to him. Very serious of a leader to the Shintai though. 
    
- Second in Command: Kan “Right Hand of the Dragon”: Red spiky hair and a very boisterous attitude, mainly controls the black market, used to be a criminal who could kill anyone until he was contracted to kill Omawari and he was spanked. 
    
- Dorei “Left leg of the dragon” / Heitei “Right leg of the dragon”: Two brothers who were stolen from their families and trained from a young age to be brutal killers, neither have their tongues so they cannot be tortured. 
    
- Ryosuke Takehiro “Left Hand of the Dragon”: 
    

- Nanako Takehiro: Ryosuke’s younger sister who he takes care of. About 15 years old bright young woman.**
