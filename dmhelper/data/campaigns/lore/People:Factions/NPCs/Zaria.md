Floors 75-100 (The Upper 25)
The most powerful kingdom in the tower and the supposed final boss. Their caste system is unique in that it is female headed and completely dependent on proximity in relationship to a family head, whether by blood or employ. Zahard is the one that makes the final decisions for the entire kingdom but the family heads or their representatives rule over their kingdoms with almost complete autonomy. 
SYMBOL: Three Red Eyes of Zahard

- Zahard: "The Human God" "The King of the Tower" "The Red Three Eyes"
    - Princesses of Zahard: Group of females chosen to serve Zahard, considered to be the “ultimate human species” and are an existence that is somewhat worshiped in Zaria and feared elsewhere. An honorable and nearly impossible achievement, one is selected only about every century and is the ultimate goal of every female in the five families. When selected, a princess is trained and then given Zahards blood through a special procedure similar to that of Agrona’s which allows him to physically control them.

		- Yura Ha Zahard
		- Rose Arie Zahard

		- Anne Zahard (Anne Eurasia Zahard)
	- Royal Enforcement Division (R.E.D): Part of the Zahard family that works to uphold his will in Zaria and throughout the tower. 
		- Structure: Shrouded in secrecy, there is a single commander who oversees all of the division and takes orders from Zahard himself. There are 66 official agents who are all given numbers 1-66 as their only identity when it comes to RED. The members are not always on the job instead pass as normal citizens until they are 'activated' by the commander with a mission. Their motivations vary vastly, most are not actually loyal to the king. 
		- History: he RED are likely part of a system designed to keep heresy inside the Tower in check. Their jurisdiction is decided by the King and only concerns the [Zahard Family](https://towerofgod.fandom.com/wiki/Zahard_Family "Zahard Family") and certain issues related to them. Due to the structure of the Zahard Family most of RED's work concerns offenses done by the princesses. These include a Princess carrying out her assigned duties, her personal conduct and the rules governing all Princesses, the 13 Month Series rules or unlawful orders issued by a Princess; the RED must uphold the name and reputation of the King and the Zahard Empire. The RED member may also ignore a Princess' offences, should they have valid reasons for doing so.

- Tu Perie: Because of the large number of wives and children Eduan has fathered, there is a lot of veiled competition among the children of the family; too much competition has created the 'official' fights. It is held once a year, with the following rule: 'When the children of Tu Perie reach the age of 10, they are to fight each other. The winners are recognised as the true children and are allowed to wear the crest of the family, but the losers become the 'abandoned' and do not get the crest'. Additionally, there is likely a lot of competition among Eduan's wives as they seek to gain favour with and power from their husband. It was mentioned that "the powers have shifted" and Tu Perie Tristan's mother said she had "lost the fight" (for power). The "house head" that was mentioned to be the person who was responsible for "casting aside" Tu Perie Tristan is likely a person who holds a high position within the Family and could even be the wife of the main branch. Those from the Tu Perie Family tend to be clever, but quite cold-hearted schemers. They also tend to be quite confident and proud people.The children are raised in a fairly typical environment consisting of schools and training with many other family members on a large area similar to school grounds.

- Poe Bidau: Known as the intellectual family among the five, they are seen as the guardians of knowledge for humanity. Most of the family leaves the territory before the age of 15 on a rite of passage known as “Enrichment” where they go to an institution or into the tower to gain a piece of knowledge that is useful to the family, whereupon they are recognized as full fledged members of the family. These ‘enriched’ members are the upper caste in the territory with the unenriched family members being the middle class and the non family members being in the lowest.

- Ha: The Ha Family does not have many branch families and the main branch of the family is centered around Yurin's two daughters. However, the two daughters do not have a friendly relationship and each claims to be the rightful heir to the family. Because of this, even within the Ha Family, there is a not-so-small quarrel about this matter.

Hands off in the family and leaves the affairs to the twins, only taking interest in the strongest members.
