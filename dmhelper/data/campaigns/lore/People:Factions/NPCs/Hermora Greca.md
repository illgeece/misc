"The Devourer of Knowledge/The Wretched Abyss”: 
- The Klansklunger: The Apostles of Hermora Greca who tend to his library. He is the most hands on with his servants, who are essentially just madmen. The most intelligent and knowledge hungry scholars may even become librarians and gain special powers and extended life in exchange for serving the library for the rest of their lives. There is a hierarchical leadership with a head librarian running the library and taking orders from Greca. Below him are the department heads who run each department of the library of which there are many, and each commands between 3-15 librarians. The librarians wear robes of deep purple lined in real gold.
- Great Library: An enormous library on the 62nd floor made by Hermora Greca, the god of knowledge to store all of the rare and forbidden knowledge in the tower. The librarians are all the apostles and most are outside of the library searching for ancient tomes and new scientific discoveries. The library is largely closed to the public with only a select few recognized scholars being allowed to view the contents of the library but that is very rare. The librarians are known to do about whatever it takes to acquire this knowledge and will even destroy small groups in order to gain their secrets, if they cannot purchase or extort them beforehand.
