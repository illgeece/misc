- Agrona Vritra: “The Leviathan” Draian who was a serpent like animal at the time of the cleave and was transformed into a human hybrid, the first Leviathan, and immediately devoured the second one without any thought. He spent the first few thousand years eating the strongest monsters and growing in power and intelligence until he was able to challenge the gods. He was the first to try and attack a godly settlement in the pre era and was wiped out to near death and forced back into his leviathan form. He spent nearly 1000 years regenerating and regaining his power before gathering allies to attack the same god by giving all creeds of intelligent beasts power through his blood whom he had defeated rather than consuming them. They managed to invade and defeat the unnamed draia who had nearly killed him before, and Agrona spread his power to his forces and began plans of more expansion with them when he was turned on by them all as they attacked him and tried to drain his power. He killed all of them but was badly hurt again, and this event shaped his current view of others, tools that are to be used but not given too much power, things to always have the upper hand over. He views himself as superior to everyone else as he is the only one except for the First Dragon Kezess Indra to change from an animal to humanoid form and gain intelligence. He hates Kezess for being more perfect and pure than him as Kezess had mastered his own power rather than steal others, and he wants more than anything to defeat him. He takes the appearance of a 5 '11 blonde man with soft curls that stop just above his ears and two horns curved more than 360 degrees that are adorned with jewelry. 
    
- Scythes: The main governors of Agrona’s territories and generals of his armies, the most powerful fighters with the most marks. The five Scythes each govern over a territory along with their 1-2 retainers who answer to them. The scythes are the ones that have seen the full wrath of Agrona before and are the ones that are most afraid of him. All have received Vritra blood. 
    

- Seris Vritra “The Blood Moon”: Scythe of Etril, she is a short slender woman with long silver-grey hair with bangs over her long black horns that go straight up just past the top of her head. She speaks softly, but every word commands the attention of even the other Scythes. 
    

- Cylrit: Rarely ever speaks, has a raspy voice. Large man with shaggy black hair that goes down right past his chin and ashen grey skin and eyes. Utterly devoted to Seris.

- Reinhard Heydrich “The Hangman”: The Scythe of the Central Dominion and Agrona’s personal torturer and experiment assistant.
