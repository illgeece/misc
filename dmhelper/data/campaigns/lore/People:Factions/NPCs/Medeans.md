 A group comprised of only women who are the chosen of [[Medena]] and given some of her powers. They reside in Medena’s old fortress of Colchis where the Living Amethyst is rooted but are everywhere, infiltrated into most of the powerful kingdoms and institutions. They have a marked hatred of men and view them as lessers. 
- Priestesses: The leaders and main powers of the Medeans, each has inhabited a potion of her power. While they obey the head priestess, her power is not absolute and they vote on many things. There is always seven priestesses and if one dies they are immediately replaced by a moot between the remaining ones.
