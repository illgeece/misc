Idol is “The Flaming Hand” which is the hand of the man who betrayed her. Was a princess in the old kingdom who was lured into a relationship with a prince of another kingdom but was tricked into an attack in his kingdom in which she was stabbed while holding onto his wrist at the second of the cleave, and she popped his hand off, becoming the flaming hand.
