Slayers Eternal Arlene's Revenge
Criminal syndicate that operates more as a religious organization devoted to the slaying of Zahard and the other family heads. They have no known headquarters, but Luslec is secretly stashed in a part of the RLD. The attitude around them is generally one of fear and loathing as they are an organization who’s purpose is only to kill, but they have some members, even slayers, who are good and do good deeds around the tower. 


- Slayers: The “gods” of S.E.A.R who are each tasked with a different target from Zahard and the five family heads. 
	1. Grace Merchea Luslec (target: Zahard):
    
	2. Imort (target: Yurin Ha):
    
	3. Pephemore Seto (target: Edahn Tu Perie):
    
	4. White (target: ):
    
	5. Empty (target: ):
    
	6. Empty (target: Zahard): formerly the seat of Karaka who went missing in the 3rd era after an attack on Zahard’s fortress. 
    

- Elders: Old and powerful affiliates of S.E.A.R who hate the Zarians and make decisions along with the slayers as well as contribute resources and lead recruitment. They are supposed to be of equal power but view the slayers as gods as well so are somewhat subservient. Much more shrouded in mystery than the slayers who are supposed to be the stars of S.E.A.R.
