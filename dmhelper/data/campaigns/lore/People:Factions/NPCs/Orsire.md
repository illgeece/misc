“The First Orc” “The Son of Sadness”:  Orcs, Honor. Product of the first rape in the tower when Dragash defiled the leader of a group of elves named the Woodland elves who went against him in the first era. While his mother Lady Trinimac was a fair lady who was full of goodness, she could not bring herself to love Orsire and he was cast out in the wilderness by her where he survived and gained strength. Famous for never having a scratch on his back in thousands of years, and for fighting honorably despite his reputation as an abomination. 
- Orsimien: The ancestral homeland of the Orc’s and the birthplace of Orsire in the old home of the Woodland Elves.
