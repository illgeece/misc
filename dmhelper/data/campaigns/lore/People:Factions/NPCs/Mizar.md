- “The Silent Hand”: god of stealing and cunning. 
    

- Hain Manda: a small group of thieves who only obey the thieves code and mostly collaborate before operating as a collective unit. The group is headed by who is usually, but not always, considered the best thief in the world, currently a man named Agustus Gane. The guild started early in the second era when Mizar took in two twin slaves freed during the freeing of the slaves by Alessia who were gifted thieves and created a small cabal of people to challenge to steal things in order to create the ultimate thief. The guild started as six people, four working under the twins, and grew from there to about 30 people at its height, where it stole many artifacts from the other Draia that had been scattered during the revolution at the behest of Mizar, but around 70 years after formation the group stole an important book from the Great Library, and the twins were locked in the Library and the few survivors scattered and were lost to the ages. In the third era the next iteration of the Hain-Manda was formed in 3E 341 when Mizar took notice of an existing small group of thieves that had been stealing many things in Zhou. Mizar ended up stealing the group’s treasure hoard and leading them to her sanctuary on the 21st floor where she invited them to form the new Hain-Manda. This time she was much less hands on with them and only intervened a few times over the next few centuries. Because of that, the group's numbers grew and shrunk based on leadership and popularity, mostly defined by an item of great value that was stolen by them. The group was at an apex around 4E 400 with the stealing of The Orb of Dragonkind from the Indra, in 4E 1400 with the stealing of The Stone of Golorr from Xyrus City, and in 4E 1920 with the stealing of a chunk of Living Amethyst from the Medeans. After that they faded into obscurity but never died out and currently are in one of their worst droughts, not having stolen an item of great value since 1920, and sentiment around the group is not good. The current leader Grane wants desperately to return the guild to its former glory from when his father was in the guild and plans to steal something big to return the guild to their former glory. The guild has no uniform but each member carries a polished dark wooden badge to confirm their identities.
