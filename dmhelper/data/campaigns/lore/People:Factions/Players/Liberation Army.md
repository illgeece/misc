The other of the 'big two' guilds, formed around the idea of sharing everything with the lower players to bring as many people as possible to the front lines. 
### History:
Kiba lost his two companions that he had known in real life in the beginning of the first day, and when looking for them he saved Jake from some PKers after he had angered them. They left to search for his friends and met Nirvana at the town square, where they learned something was amiss with the respawning. They adventured back to where the bodies of Kiba’s friends are and found Periel investigating their bodies. After interrogating him they recruited him and started questing together in order to discover him near where Kiba’s friends respawned at, nursing a cat familiar who was dying. When everyone was teleported back to the central square, they were teleported next to Hera and Loki who are siblings, and they all stuck together out of convenience as to not die and began the quests in earnest. Their motivation to climb the tower at the forefront was their experiences with death and the urge to prevent more deaths, Jake’s is unknown.
