The first official guild in the game formed by the now dead Diavel, known as the most powerful in the game.


Leader: Lind
Sub-Leader: Hafner
Lieutenants: Yariel, 
### History:
Started with Diavel and his companions (Lind, Hafner, Trin, Yariel, Shivata) whom he found in the middle square after dueling with all of them. He defeated each handily and then asked if they wanted to join his guild. Each one essentially joined to become stronger by studying Diavel. After Diavel died, most of the group only stayed because they felt they owed it to him in death rather than because of an obligation to each other or belief in Lind.
